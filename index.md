Our goal is to revolutionize integrated photonics via open-source software.

Our plan for 2022 is to release an FDTD simulation engine that is
- **fast**: GPU-accelerated for 100x faster simulation than existing solutions (Lumerical, Meep, RSoft), 
- **differentiable**: integrated into modern ML frameworks (JAX, PyTorch) for easy scalability and optimization, and
- **free**: as in beer (no license fees) and freedom (open-source).

SPINS Photonics is the follow-up to [SPINS-B](https://github.com/stanfordnqp/spins-b).
